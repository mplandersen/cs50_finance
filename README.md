#### Description

My submission for CS50x PSET9. I built a stock market simulation web app with several features. Some of the html and CSS was pre-written by the course.
Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, Jinja, flask, Javascript were used.

Features:
  - Registers user and grants $10k (if username isn't taken)
  - Change password
  - Log in/log out
  - Lookup quotes provided by real-time updates using Yahoo Finance API
  - 'Buy'/'sell' stock
  - Portfolio summary of stocks purchased, real-time value (stock + cash)
  - Transactional history
